\chapter*{Preface}
When I first came up with the idea to write a PostgreSQL DBA book, my intention was go 
through a commercial publisher.\newline

Shortly I changed my mind as I became aware the uniqueness of a PostgreSQL DBA oriented book.
I took the decision to keep this book, and all the subsequent I'll write, free. This 
hopefully will spread the PostgreSQL knowledge becoming a reference to help the 
PostgreSQL professionals.\newline

Before you start reading this book I'm begging your pardon in advance for my bad English.\newline

As I did not study English and unfortunately my mothertongue is not English. The following text 
will very likely be full of typos (I'm affected by some dyslexia as well) and bad grammar.\newline

Anyway, my promise  is this book and all the subsequent in the series, will be free as freedom 
and as beer.\newline
However, if you want to help me to cleanup the text you're very welcome to fork the github 
repository where I'm storing the latex sources \href{https://github.com/the4thdoctor/pgdba\_books}{

\section*{Intended audience}
Database administrators, System administrators, Developers

\section*{Book structure}
This book assumes the reader knows how to perform basic user operations such as
connecting to the database and creating tables.

The book covers the basic aspects of database administration from installation
to cluster management.

A couple of chapters are dedicated to the logical and physical structure in
order to show both sides of coin.  Maintenance and disaster recovery
backup/restore completes the ``other side of the monitor's`` picture.
The final chapter is for developers who want to avoid common pitfalls when
using PostgreSQL.

\section*{Version and platform}
This book is based on PostgreSQL version 9.3 running on Debian GNU Linux 7.
References to older versions or different platforms are explicitly specified.

\section*{Thanks}
A big thank you to Craig Barnes for the priceless work on the book review.\newline
The beautiful cover has been made by \href{http://www.bonland.eu/}{
