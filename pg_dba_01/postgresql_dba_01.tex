\chapter*{Preface}
When I first came up with the idea to write a PostgreSQL DBA book, I intended
to publish it commercially through a publisher.

Soon after I changed my mind, as there's a huge lack of knowledge on
PostgreSQL and very few DBA oriented books around.

I decided that this book series shall stay free in order to reach as many people
as possible, and hopefully become a reference to keep under your pillow.

Be warned before you start reading this book, I'm asking to be patient with me
and my bad English.

As I did not study English and I'm not native, my writing will be probably wrong
with many typos (I'm affected by some dyslexia as well) and bad grammar.

In exchange I'll promise this book, and all the subsequent in the series, will
start free and will remain free. Free as in freedom and as in beer.

This first book covers the basics of PostgreSQL.

A brief introduction, installation, and an analysis of the RDBMS deep enough to
wet your appetite, but not so deep to scare you. Not yet at least.




\section*{Intended audience}
Database administrators, System administrators, Developers

\section*{Book structure}
This book assumes the reader knows how to perform basic user operations such as
connecting to the database and creating tables.

The book covers the basic aspects of database administration from installation
to cluster management.

A couple of chapters are dedicated to the logical and physical structure in
order to show both sides of coin.  Maintenance and disaster recovery
backup/restore completes the ``other side of the monitor's`` picture.
The final chapter is for developers who want to avoid common pitfalls when
using PostgreSQL.

\section*{Version and platform}
This book is based on PostgreSQL version 9.3 running on Debian GNU Linux 7.
References to older versions or different platforms are explicitly specified.

\section*{Thanks}
A big thank you to Craig Barnes for the priceless work on the book review.\newline

The beautiful cover is made by Chiaretta e Bon
