\chapter*{Preface}
When I first came with the idea to write a PostgreSQL DBA book, I decided
to publish via a commercial publisher. 
Shortly I changed my mind, as there's a massive lack of knowledge on the
PostgreSQL database and few dba oriented books around.

Then I decided this book series shall stay free in order to reach as many people
as
possible, and hopefully become a reference to keep under the pillow.

Be warned before you start reading this book, I'm asking to be patient with me
and my bad English.

As I did not study English and I'm not native, my writing will be probably wrong
with many typos (I'm affected by some dyslexia as well) and bad grammar. 

In exchange I'll promise this book, and all the subsequent, will start free and
will remain
free. Free as freedom and as beer. 

This first book covers the basics on PostgreSQL.

A brief introduction, the installation and a deep enough to wet your taste
analysis on the RDBMS, but not so deep to scare you. Not yet at least.




\section*{Intended audience}
Database administrators, System administrators, Developers

\section*{Book structure}
In this book assumes the reader knows how to perform the user operations like 
connecting to the database or creating tables.

The book covers the basic aspects of the database administration from the 
product installation to the cluster management.

A couple of chapters are dedicated to the logical and physical structure in 
order to show the two coin's faces. The maintenance and the important task of 
backup/restore completes the ``other side of the monitor's`` picture.
The final chapter is dedicated to the developers who want to avoid the common 
mistakes and wrong assumptions on PostgreSQL.

\section*{Version and platform}
This book cover the database version 9.3 on Debian GNU Linux 7.0.
References to older version or different platform are explicitly specified.
