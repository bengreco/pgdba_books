\chapter{The memory}
\label{ch:PGMEMORY}
The PostgreSQL memory at first sight looks simple. If compared with the complex structures implemented in 
the other DBMS to a careless reader could seem rudimentary. However, the memory and in particular the 
shared buffers implementation is complex and sophisticated. This chapter will dig down deep into the 
PostgreSQL's memory.

\section{The shared buffer}
The shared buffer is a segment allocated at cluster's startup. Its size is determined by the GUC parameter 
shared\_buffers and the size can be changed only restarting the cluster. The shared buffer is used 
to manage the data pages as seen in \ref{sec:CLUBACKEND}, which are called buffers when loaded in 
rhw memory. Having a RAM segment is not uncommon in the database universe. Is a rapid exchange 
area where the buffers are kept across the sessions and keeps the data near the CPU. Like his competitors 
PostgreSQL strives to keep in memory what is important things and not everything. In the era of the 
\textit{in memory databases} this could seems an obsolete concept. Unfortunately the truth is that the 
resources, and so the money, are not infinite. Before digging into the technical details we'll have a look 
to the history of the memory manager. The way PostgreSQL sticks an elephant into a small car without 
Timelord technology.

Back in the old days PostgreSQL was quite rudimentary. The version 7.4 did not had tablespaces, it was 
without a  nor a mechanism to prevent the XID wraparound failure (except the routine vacuuming of course) 
and the memory the memory manager was a simple LRU buffer. Since then the algorithm evolved to become a 
simple but sophisticated system to cache effectively the buffers. We'll look briefly to the memory 
manager's history.
