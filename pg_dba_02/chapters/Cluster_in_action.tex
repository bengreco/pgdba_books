\chapter{The cluster in action}
In order to understand how PostgreSQL deliver its functions we'll take a all around look to the cluster's 
activity. We'll start looking to the memory interacting with the disk and how the backends interact each 
other. The description is purposely not going into technical details. The main goal is to get a global 
picture of a day in the life of a PostgreSQL's cluster.
