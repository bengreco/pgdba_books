\chapter{The cluster in action}
In order to understand how PostgreSQL delivers the data we'll take look all around to the cluster's 
activity. The chapter will not deep into technical details. The main goal is to get a global picture of a 
``day in the life'' of a PostgreSQL's cluster.

\section{After the startup}
As soon as the cluster is up it starts accepting the connections. Usually, before any backend is connected 
the cluster waits without any further action. The postgres main process starts listening on the port 
indicated in the postgresql.conf's parameter port for the addresses listed in listen\_addresses.
